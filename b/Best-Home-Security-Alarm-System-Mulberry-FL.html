For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself.
