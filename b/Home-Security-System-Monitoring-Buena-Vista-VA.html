<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage area. A lot, in fact, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.
