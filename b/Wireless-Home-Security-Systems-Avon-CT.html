Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
