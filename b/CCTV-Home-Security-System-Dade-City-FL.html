<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately turn off the heater.
