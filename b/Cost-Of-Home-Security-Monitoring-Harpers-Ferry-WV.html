There are laws in some locations that prohibit anyone from having a device connected to their telephone that will immediately call the police or fire departments in an emergency situation. A system that calls a security company is legal and they will in turn alert the authorities. The app is offered for both Android and iOS. Moreover, this home security system makes whatever easy for the user because of the full automation and combination features with lots of smart home devices such as the Amazon Echo Dot.</p>

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are offering to the public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
