<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still exceptional, and it's a little better value - though its price is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the typical Arlo qualities in regards to the strong develop quality, superb camera video footage, tons of smart functions and a sleek app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
