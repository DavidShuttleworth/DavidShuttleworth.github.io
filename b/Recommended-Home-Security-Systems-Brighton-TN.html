<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
