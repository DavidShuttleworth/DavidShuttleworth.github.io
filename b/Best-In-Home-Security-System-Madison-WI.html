We've found great deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brand names offered. In some cases you don't have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list offer you a Do It Yourself alternative. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer care track record among the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this up to the reality that ADT has a number of million more customers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
