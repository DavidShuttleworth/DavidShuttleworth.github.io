<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance.

A wireless bridge is a great option for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
