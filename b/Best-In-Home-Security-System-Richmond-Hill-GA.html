<p>The real reason cameras are usually deployed is to lower much pettier criminal offenses. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not lowered criminal offense. "As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general downward trend in offences and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had decreased criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
