Deep Guard's camera-based systems use expert system and real human guards to proactively battle criminal activity. However starting at $100 monthly for monitoring, it's definitely not cheap.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe features an abnormally long trial period where customers can test out their system while secured by a complete money-back assurance. Many companies permit customers a 30-day trial duration-- but SimpliSafe provides people 60 days, which must be sufficient time to be familiar with the system and make certain it deals with your home and your way of life.
