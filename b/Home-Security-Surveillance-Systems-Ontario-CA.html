<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, however the black and white version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. However the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
