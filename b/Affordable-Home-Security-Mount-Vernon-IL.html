<p>Most modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video to digital, which assists to extend storage capacity, makes it a lot easier to search archived video, and likewise permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple places. Frequently, the mere existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or damaged by the more figured out burglars. If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they may also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
