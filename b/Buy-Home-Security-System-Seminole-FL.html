<p>Besides resolution, likewise think about the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, however not all angles are created equal. Depending upon the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge range in terms of the camera's vision cone.

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe offer valid only for those who buy a new SimpliSafe system that consists of at least one (1) Base Station, one (1) Keypad and one (1) Extra Sensing Unit.

However-- big surprise-- indoor cameras are created to be used inside. You probably won't have the ability to make an indoor camera do double-duty by pointing it out a window to see what's happening on the street or in your backyard.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
