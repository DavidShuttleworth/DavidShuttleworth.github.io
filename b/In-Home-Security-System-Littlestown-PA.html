<h3>Security System With Monitor in Littlestown PA</h3>

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
