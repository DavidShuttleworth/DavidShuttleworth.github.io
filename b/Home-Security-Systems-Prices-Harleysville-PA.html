Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you walk by.

<p>For the many part, wireless security equipment is just as visible as you want it to be. Window sensing units are quickly hid behind blinds or curtains, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.
