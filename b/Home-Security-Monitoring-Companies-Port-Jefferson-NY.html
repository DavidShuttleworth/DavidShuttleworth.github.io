<p>The loudest of the wise alarm we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's an issue. During testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be gotten used to account for pets, too. The alarm is just one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your property.

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your wise outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly simple.
