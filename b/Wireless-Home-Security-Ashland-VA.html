The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for keeping an eye on visitors and plan deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your backyard vulnerable. If you have a big yard or outbuildings to secure, this system may not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. However you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.
