<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on produced to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>

It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it doesn't have wires that can be cut.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
