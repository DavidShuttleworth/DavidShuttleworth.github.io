<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
