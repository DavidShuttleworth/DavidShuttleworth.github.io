<p>Network cameras can be utilized for extremely cheap surveillance options (needing one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to change entire CCTV setups (cameras end up being network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors become computer systems with TFT screens and specialised software application. Digital video manufacturers claim that turning CCTV installations into digital video installations is naturally much better).</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of taping storage area. So much, in reality, that they require about 4 times the hard disk area of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
