<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense.

As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
