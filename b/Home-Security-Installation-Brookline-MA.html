<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning numerous decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet affordable systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible transgressors are less likely to commit criminal activity if they think they are being watched or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by altering a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the offender should understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its desired result.</p>

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
