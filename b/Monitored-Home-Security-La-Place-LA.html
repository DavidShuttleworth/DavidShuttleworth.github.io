<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Idea: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit.

We would recommend thinking about a DIY home security system rather if you desire to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
