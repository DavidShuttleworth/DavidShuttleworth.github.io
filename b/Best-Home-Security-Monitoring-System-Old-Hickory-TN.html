<p>Local storage: Some cameras consist of memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can save video right on the device. It's an appealing function as it can get rid of the cost of monthly storage costs.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
