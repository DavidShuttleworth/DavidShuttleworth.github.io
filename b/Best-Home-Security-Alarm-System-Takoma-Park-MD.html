<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
