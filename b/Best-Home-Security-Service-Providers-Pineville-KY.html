<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store.
