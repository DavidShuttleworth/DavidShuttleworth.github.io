As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
