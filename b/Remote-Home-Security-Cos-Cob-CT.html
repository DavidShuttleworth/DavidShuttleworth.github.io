<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
