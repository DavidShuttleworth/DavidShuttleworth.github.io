<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible wrongdoers are less likely to devote criminal activity if they believe they are being seen or have a higher danger of being apprehended. This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
