<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they might be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
