<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras lower criminal offense. HD CCTV systems work with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that suggests you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system.
