In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can alert authorities of crimes as they occur, which can allow officers to react rapidly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<h3>Burglar Alarms For Homes in Hampden ME</h3>
<p>The loudest of the wise alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anyone in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be gotten used to represent pets, too.

The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensors. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private guard. A number of cities also require a license to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
