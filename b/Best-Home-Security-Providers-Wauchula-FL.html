Wyze's recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
