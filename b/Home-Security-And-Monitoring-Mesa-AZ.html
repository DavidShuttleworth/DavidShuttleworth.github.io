This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to upset can be reduced by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Commercial cameras outshine their more affordable cousins since they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video.</p>
