It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
