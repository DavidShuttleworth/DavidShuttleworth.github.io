<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a sensational worth. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>A good professional alarm monitoring company will have quick action times, which is important for your safety and security. Research studies have revealed that approximately 70 percent of break-ins that are not completed are because of the sound of an alarm.

In our screening, we paid specific attention to recording quality and length, frequency of notifies, the app smart-home, geofencing, and interface combination.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
