The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 free false alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal guard. Several cities likewise require an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
