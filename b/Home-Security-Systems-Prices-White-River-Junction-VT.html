CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit should know the added surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>
