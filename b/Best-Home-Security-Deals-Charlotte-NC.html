<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
