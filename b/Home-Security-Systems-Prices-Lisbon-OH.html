Of our top 5, SimpliSafe is the most flexible for the contract-averse. Some brand names, like Frontpoint, even let you move your equipment to a new home totally free.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
