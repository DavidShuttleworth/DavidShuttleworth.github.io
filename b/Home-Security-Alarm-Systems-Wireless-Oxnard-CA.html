<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
