<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Nearly all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their primary interaction source.
