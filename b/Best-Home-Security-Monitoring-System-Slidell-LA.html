<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and for how long you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage area rapidly.
