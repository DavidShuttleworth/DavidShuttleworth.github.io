<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
