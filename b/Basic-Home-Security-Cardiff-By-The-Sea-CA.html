Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.

<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Renters, unlike property owners, generally prevent making long-term modifications to their homes.

Typically, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more figured out intruders. If burglars can not see any security cameras, they might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
