<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in Montana</h3>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
