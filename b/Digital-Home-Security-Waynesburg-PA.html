The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera gives you an excellent field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more information you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video footage, you can use an app on your phone or a web browser link on your computer system.</p>
<p>During the night, though it lacks the complete IR LED variety of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the issue.
