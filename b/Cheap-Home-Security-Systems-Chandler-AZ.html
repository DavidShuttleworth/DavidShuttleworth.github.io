<p>Unlike standard burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically located in the entryway hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensors have been activated, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours). However, smart alarms do need a center that permits the different elements to wirelessly connect. However for most wise alarms this hub can be put throughout your home.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime avoidance created to avoid both individual and property criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops.

It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
