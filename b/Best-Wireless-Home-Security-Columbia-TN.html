<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
