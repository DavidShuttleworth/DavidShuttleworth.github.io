<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
