<p>You'll need to acquire a Nest Aware subscription in order to save video footage. You can pick in between rolling 5, ten, and 30-day storage options, but you can't pick one rate to cover all cameras.

Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Web cam.</p>
