<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also nice metal construction.

Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
