The answer depends upon a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to store and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
