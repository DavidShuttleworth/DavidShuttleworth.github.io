<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed homes) a ineffective and costly approach to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
