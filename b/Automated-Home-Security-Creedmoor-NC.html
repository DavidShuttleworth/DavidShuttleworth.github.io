Still the likeliest home security sign you'll see strolling down the street, ADT stays at the top of the field by supplying a broad series of services that most of its competitors can not match, owing its established name and large amount of capital. Couple of other home security companies will permit consumers to link security systems from other providers, or offer such a wide-ranging choice of plans, including custom options, but ADT does.</p>
<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensors, cameras, and numerous detectors all connected to a main control board through radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage area for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
