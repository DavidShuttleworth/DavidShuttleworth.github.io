(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smart device or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to install the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
