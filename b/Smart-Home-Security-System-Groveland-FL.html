<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is usually open or normally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and alerts, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived a method of not only offering the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
