<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
