<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to police ability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed homes) a ineffective and costly approach to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
