<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
