<h3>CCTV Home Security in Texas</h3>

<p>Beyond the scope of securing a business from theft and vandalism is the financial protection that a security system supplies.

<p>You can use a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, meaning you won't be able to link it straight to other third-party gadgets like wise locks or automate specific actions in the home. You can, however, use Alexa to arm or deactivate the SimpliSafe system and link it to your Nest Thermostat to save energy based upon when you're home or away. But these integrations aren't rather as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>
<p>As with the Nest, if you include a paid membership to this camera, it ends up being a lot smarter (and, minus some subtle differences, the subscription prepares put the Circle 2 on a par with the Nest in regards to functions). If you go away for a couple of days, a subscription also guarantees that you'll be covered. The Circle Safe Basic plan offers 2 week of video storage for $4 per month per camera (compared to $5 for five days for Nest Aware).
