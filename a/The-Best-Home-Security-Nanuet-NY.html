<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
