<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
