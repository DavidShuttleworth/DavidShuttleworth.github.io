<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they might be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies."
