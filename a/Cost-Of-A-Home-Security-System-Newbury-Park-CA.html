Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
