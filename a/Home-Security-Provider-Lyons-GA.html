<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
