<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police action to alarmed properties) a pricey and inefficient  method to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
