<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We recommend the eight-piece package since it comes with several door and window sensors for full coverage. We likewise suggest including a doorbell camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the in advance cost of the control panel, activation costs, monitoring fees and all equipment.
