For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day.

No complex hardware such as a digital video recorder (DVR) is needed on-site. To see your center in real-time and evaluate current occasions, all you need is a password.
