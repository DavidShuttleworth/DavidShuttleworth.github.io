This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the taped video footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
