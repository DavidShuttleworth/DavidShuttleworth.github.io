With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes use just to NVR systems, but they cut out other elements that would be necessary for a DVR system, like additional source of power and the BNC cables utilized to connect cameras to the DVR.
