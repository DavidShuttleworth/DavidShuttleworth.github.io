<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP stands for web protocol) network, frequently the same information network the rest of a company utilizes. A different network using category 5 electrical wiring can be used if bandwidth is a problem.

A couple of designs use batteries, making placement more versatile, but this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors area. Wi-Fi coverage likewise impacts where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider upgrading your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smart device or laptop computer gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>

Both the initial House system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we tested that also works with HomeKit.
