<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Considering that the house owner is in charge of the system, cops are only contacted if there's a genuine emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call police if a homeowner can't validate an incorrect alarm. If  authorities are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching authorities needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for subsequent penalties and incorrect alarms.</p>
