<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center included here - each camera connects directly to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
