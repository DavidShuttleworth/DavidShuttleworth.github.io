<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
