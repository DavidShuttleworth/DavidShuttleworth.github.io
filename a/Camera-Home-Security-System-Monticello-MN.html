If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
