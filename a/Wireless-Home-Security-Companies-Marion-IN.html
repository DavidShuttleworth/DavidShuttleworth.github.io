<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
