<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
