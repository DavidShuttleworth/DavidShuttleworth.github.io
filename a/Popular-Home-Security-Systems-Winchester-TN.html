<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
