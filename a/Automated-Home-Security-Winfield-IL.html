<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
