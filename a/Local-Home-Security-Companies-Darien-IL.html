Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you walk by.
