<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
