There are advantages to both landline and cellular monitoring, so do not simply depend on cost when making your option. Home alarm monitored with a standard landline don't need power to work.

You can generally tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing automobiles if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day.</p>

(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)
