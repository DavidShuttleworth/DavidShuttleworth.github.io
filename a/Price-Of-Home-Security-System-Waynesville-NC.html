<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

Smart alarm systems altered that. Initially, conventional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company. The client paid regular monthly fees.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements!
