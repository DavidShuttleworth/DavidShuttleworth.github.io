<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

Some systems can then sound an alarm or get in touch with the emergency services, and lots of also enable you to talk through the camera.
