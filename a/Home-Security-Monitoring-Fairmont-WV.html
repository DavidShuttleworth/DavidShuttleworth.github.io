It is also geared up with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to zoom in and catch details such as facial functions in case of burglaries.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting.
