We've discovered great deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands readily available. Often you don't have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use just expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a Do It Yourself alternative.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue.
