"As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were noted in particular classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had lowered crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
