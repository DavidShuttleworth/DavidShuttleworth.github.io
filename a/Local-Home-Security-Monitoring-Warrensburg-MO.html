Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 30 days.

The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
