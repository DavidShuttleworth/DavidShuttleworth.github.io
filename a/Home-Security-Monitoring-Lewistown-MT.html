The directions are extremely detailed and the 200m range of the alarm implies it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds in addition to your home. The alarm does not consist of a wifi security camera however you can buy a number of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring choice with this alarm.</p>
