<p>This is the best-scoring clever alarm we checked. It was very easy to set up, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to activate when any of the sensing units were activated. We love that it features both external and internal sirens and will even work with Philips Hue clever lights, too. The directions are extremely detailed and the 200m range of the alarm implies it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds in addition to your home. The alarm does not consist of a wifi security camera however you can buy a number of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring choice with this alarm.</p>
