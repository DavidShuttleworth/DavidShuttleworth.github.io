We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.
