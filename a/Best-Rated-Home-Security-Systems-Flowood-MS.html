<h3>Home Security CCTV System in Mississippi</h3>
<p>Video surveillance systems and devices deter theft and vandalism and record culprits. Dome and hidden cameras install out of sight to record suspicious activity and secure residential or commercial property. Accessories such as wall brackets and camera housings can help to stabilize and secure closed-circuit tv (CCTV) systems from outdoor aspects. Interact with your alarm from anywhere by looking at live video, or addressing your front door while you're at work. Smarter security options keep you in control when you are away.</p>

<p>When your camera are set up, you can pick whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is normally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. However, you might choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas).

The security offering we are describing here-- which was at first flagged to us by a reader-- falls under that basic banner, and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepage.
