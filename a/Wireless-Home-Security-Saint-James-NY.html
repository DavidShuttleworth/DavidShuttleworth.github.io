Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to save and for how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
