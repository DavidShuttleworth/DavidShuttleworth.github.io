Over 97% of home security alarms in Seattle end up being false. That's why the Seattle Cops Department (SPD) presented its False Alarm Program in 2004. It uses charges and alarm registration to lower the variety of incorrect alarms to which the department needs to react. The primary intent of the program is to conserve the city money and time Both charges help the city make up for that loss, and penalize your company when police are dispatched to your house just to find there's no emergency.

If agreement strategies do not appeal to you, think about Blue by ADT, which uses Do It Yourself installation and self-monitoring. Some alarm use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to confirm the legitimacy of an alarm.
