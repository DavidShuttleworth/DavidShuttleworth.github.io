<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. HD CCTV systems work with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that suggests you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.
