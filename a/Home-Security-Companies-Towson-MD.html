<p>As described by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a form of formal surveillance," implying that not just does CCTV have the capability to replace cops or security officers but CCTV can also improve officers' capabilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can notify police of crimes as they happen, which can enable officers to react quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a larger scale, using CCTV also provides the possibility of assisting in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a criminal offense may assist in prosecutions and investigations (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
