A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that items are seldom specifically the exact same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
