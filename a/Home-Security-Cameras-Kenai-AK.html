<p>Ring is among the most significant names in the plugged-in home security game, and the Ring Indoor Webcam is designed to couple with the company's Ring - Always Home app, along with,'s Turner explains, video doorbells. You can even match multiple cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However because a lot of retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some extra cash while giving a customer change, for example), we think it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you need.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
