This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
