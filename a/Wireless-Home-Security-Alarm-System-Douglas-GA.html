These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then connects to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the taped footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
