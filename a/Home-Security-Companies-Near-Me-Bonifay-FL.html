<h3>Home Security Systems In My Area in Florida</h3>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
