<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>Rates-- There is no agreements with SimpliSafe. You just purchase a system to your own requirements and own it. There is no service arrangement or even any need to buy a monitoring package. What's more, you can Do It Yourself install or use expert installation services at $199. Equipment costs begin at $99 for a single SimpliCam, and packages are available that consist of both equipment and monitoring. Pricing for this these packages vary from $299 to $489, depending upon all the whistles and bells you desire.</p>
