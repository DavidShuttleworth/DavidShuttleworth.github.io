The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
