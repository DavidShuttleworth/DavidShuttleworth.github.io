Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
