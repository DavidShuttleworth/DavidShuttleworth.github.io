<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
