Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
