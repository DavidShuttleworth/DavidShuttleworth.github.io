<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
