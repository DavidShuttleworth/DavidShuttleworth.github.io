<p>The genuine factor cameras are usually deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have not lowered criminal offense. "As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the general downward trend in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually reduced criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
