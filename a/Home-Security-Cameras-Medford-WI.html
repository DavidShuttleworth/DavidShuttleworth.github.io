The response depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to keep and for how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
