In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
