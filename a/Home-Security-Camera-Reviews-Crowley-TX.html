In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Some apps will even utilize your phone's location services to immediately deactivate the system and equip according to your physical area. The more pricey systems usually feature a wall-mounted panel that acts as an interactions center, with a touch-screen screen that allows you to do whatever the app does. The display lets you interact with an expert monitoring service when an alarm is set off and see video from any of the installed security cameras.</p>
