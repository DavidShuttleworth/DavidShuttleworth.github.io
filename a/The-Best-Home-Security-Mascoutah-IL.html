If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed properties) a pricey and ineffective  technique to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
