In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

<h3>Outdoor Wireless Security Camera Williamston SC 29697</h3>
<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for property owners.
