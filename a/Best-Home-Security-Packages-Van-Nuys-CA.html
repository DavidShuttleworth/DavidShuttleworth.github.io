<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. Some people might state that we should not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they get into personal privacy.

A wireless bridge is a fantastic alternative for long variety circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>

Offered their tubular style, they have space for night-vision and IR features, and they have much better range and zoom capabilities than the flatter dome security cameras.</p>
