When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which suggests. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
