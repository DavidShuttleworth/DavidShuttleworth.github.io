<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and costly approach to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
