<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately switch off the heater. You can immediately make the wise lights turn on to frighten away possible robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>

<p>Another way to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a gadget is similar in performance to a PC with a capture card and proper video recording software Unlike PCs, a lot of DVRs developed for CCTV purposes are ingrained devices that need less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based option, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.
