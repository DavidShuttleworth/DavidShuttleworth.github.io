<h3>Home Alarm Security La Grange IL 60525</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should supply at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with tape-recording gaps throughout crucial security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd advise one of our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for checking in on family and family pets-- or stray felines sliding around your lawn.</p>

With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
