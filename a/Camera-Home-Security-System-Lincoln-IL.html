<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, positioning is more flexible. When they open, contact sensing units are the first thing you need to buy together with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will alert you. Other home security parts include motion sensing units, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons.</p>
